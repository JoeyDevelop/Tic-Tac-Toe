This Tic-Tac-Toe project was made as part of my The Odin Project curriculum. It took me a while as I decided to rewrite my JS script many times. Things I learned:

 - Increased familiarity with array methods.
 - The difference between if else statements and switch statements and when one is better then the other.
 - The basics of session storage.
 - How to better organize my code (js file)
